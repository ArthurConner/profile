				p Good answers come from good questions. I believe that
					| software is converstation with our wants and needs, both of which
					| change over time. 
				p We can use metrics to measure how close we are (and I have implemented many), 
					|but ultimately we are guided
					| by the users of our products. The secret is to listen to them.
				p It is vital that we can communicate. Having over twenty years in the software industry
					| I can help avoid prior mistakes, while at the same time show how to navigate towards the future

				p Once the software has been designed you need someone who can execute the project plan.
					| As Steve Jobs put it: "Real artists ship."
				p I have built several on top of iTunes store apps, and have equally gotten
					| several late projects back on track after joining. It is said that the last 10% of a project
					| takes 80% of the time. It doesn't have to.

				p I have run marathons in four different decades and understand what it means
					| to go long.
				p At the heart of it is to have a plan, and then to follow it as best you can
					| while allowing the flexibility to change if obstacles arise.
					| This combination of discipline and awareness is vital to software development
					| cycles.
